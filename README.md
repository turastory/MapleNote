# Maple Note

"Maple Note" is a simple companion app for those playing [MapleStory](https://maplestory.nexon.com), A MMORPG of Nexon.

It was started from my experience - This game is not kind to new-comers and has a lot of things to do, in order to get used to it and ready to enjoy the whole contents.

On the other hand, this is my side project for further experience - product planning/management, design, server, etc.

## Overall Structure

### Composite Build

I'm testing [Composite Build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) in this project. In order to build the project, you should clone my [android-toolbox](https://github.com/turastory/android-toolbox) repository within the same folder where you cloned the project.

## Design

You can find out the whole design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/96vzMlKcAj1SHnnUisH4yd/Maple?node-id=0%3A1).
